  <strong>1. What is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) </strong>  <br>
-> An application layer protocol used to transmit 'hypermedia' documents like HTML. <br>
<br>
<strong>2. Why is HTTP called a stateless protocol? </strong><br>
-> It is called a stateless protocol as each request is executed independently, without any knowledge of the requests that were executed before it, which means once the transaction ends the connection between the browser and the server is also lost.  <br>
<br>
<strong>3. Describe the three phases of establishing a session using client-server protocols such as HTTP</strong> <br>

-> (1)The client establishes a TCP connection (or the appropriate connection if the transport layer is not TCP). <br>
   (2)The client sends its request, and waits for the answer. <br>
   (3)The server processes the request, sending back its answer, providing a status code and appropriate data. <br>
<br>
<strong>4. Describe the parameters on a get and post request. </strong><br>
-> GET : The HTTP GET method requests a representation of the specified resource.<br>
   POST: The keys and values are encoded in a data structure and non alphanumeric characters are percent encoded.<br>
<br>
<strong>5. What are the HTTP response status code and What do the HTTP status codes, 200, and 404 indicate?</strong> <br>
-> Response status codes indicate whether requests are successfully completed or not. <br>
   HTTP status code 200 - the request has succeeded. <br>
   HTTP status code 404 - the server was unable to find the requested resource. <br>
 <br>

<strong>6. What are HTTP cookies? Give an example.</strong> <br>
-> It is data sent by the server to a client's web browser such that the browser may store it and send it back with requests to the same server at a later point in time. <br>
The option to stay signed in or to remember passwords during login to online services are the result of cookies. <br>
<br>
<strong>7. Why are cookies a security issue?</strong> <br>
-> They can be read an modified/edited by those who have access to a clients hard disk in spite of the security measures taken to ensure cookies cannot fall into the hands of <br>
third parties and only go to the intended recipient. <br>
<br>
<strong>8. Describe session hijacking and XSS</strong> <br>
-> XSS, referring to cross site scripting is a security gap which allows an attacker to inject malicious client side code into the website. This code is later executed by the <br>
victims of the attack and allow the attacker to get past security/access controls and subsequently impersonate users. <br>
Session Hijacking relies on an attackers knowledge of a users session cookie. Once a user is authenticated on the server side, the attacker is capable of using the session cookie to <br>
hijack the session on their own browser. <br>
<br>

<strong>9. Describe Cross-site request forgery(CSRF)-></strong> <br>
-> CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) is an attack that impersonates a trusted user and sends a website unwanted commands.<br>
<br>

<strong>10. What are Cross-site HTTP requests (CORS) and what requests use CORS?</strong> <br>
-> They are requests for resources belonging to a different domain than the domain of the resource that makes the request. <br>
CSS Shapes from images makes such requests. <br>
